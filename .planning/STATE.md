# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [02-02] Suppression guard in import worker runs before updateExisting check — suppressed contacts skipped unconditionally
- [02-02] isSuppressed continue skips both update AND list-add — no separate list-membership guard needed
- [02-02] COMP-02/03/04/05/08 verified by code trace — all already correctly implemented
- [Phase 02-compliance]: physical_address stored as NOT NULL DEFAULT '' — empty string means not configured, avoids nullable column complexity
- [Phase 02-compliance]: SNS idempotency via partial unique index + ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING with numInsertedOrUpdatedRows guard to prevent counter drift
- [Phase 03-01]: detectMachineOpen exported for direct unit testing without DB mocks
- [Phase 03-01]: MACHINE_UA_PATTERNS uses case-insensitive regex to catch variant capitalizations
- [Phase 03-01]: recordOpen unchanged — machine open path already correctly omits first_open_at (DATA-05)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Phase 1: Scheduled campaign trigger (BUG-05)~~ RESOLVED — scheduler.ts created
- ~~Phase 1: Resend-to-non-openers wire-up (BUG-06)~~ RESOLVED — wired in bulk-send completion path
- Phase 6: PgBouncer version must be >= 1.21 for prepared statement safety in transaction mode — verify from docker-compose.yml
- Phase 6: Bull Board is currently a placeholder container — needs scoping (config-only or full build)
- All phases: SES account sending limit may differ from the 40/sec default — verify via SES console before Phase 9
