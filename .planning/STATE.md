## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [02-02] Suppression guard in import worker runs before updateExisting check — suppressed contacts skipped unconditionally
- [02-02] isSuppressed continue skips both update AND list-add — no separate list-membership guard needed
- [02-02] COMP-02/03/04/05/08 verified by code trace — all already correctly implemented
- [Phase 02-compliance]: physical_address stored as NOT NULL DEFAULT '' — empty string means not configured, avoids nullable column complexity
- [Phase 02-compliance]: SNS idempotency via partial unique index + ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING with numInsertedOrUpdatedRows guard to prevent counter drift
- [Phase 03-01]: detectMachineOpen exported for direct unit testing without DB mocks
- [Phase 03-01]: MACHINE_UA_PATTERNS uses case-insensitive regex to catch variant capitalizations
- [Phase 03-01]: recordOpen unchanged — machine open path already correctly omits first_open_at (DATA-05)
- [Phase 03-02]: calculateBayesianWinProbability exported for direct unit testing without DB mocks
- [Phase 03-02]: WIN_PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD = 0.95 hardcoded; minSampleSize defaults to 100, overridable via ab_test_config
- [Phase 04-02]: shouldDecrementOnError set immediately after executeTakeFirstOrThrow - message record creation is the point of no return for Redis counter decrement
- [Phase 04-02]: Finally block does basic SENDING->SENT transition only, not resend-trigger - acceptable to skip on error completion path
- [Phase 04-02]: total_sent only increments on confirmed SES send - DATA-07 does not require failure counting
- [Phase 04-01]: Tracking route failures use request.log.error (Pino), service/plugin non-critical failures use console.warn to differentiate infrastructure errors from housekeeping
- [Phase 04-01]: Fire-and-forget model preserved in all five catch sites — no await added; pixel/redirect responses still return immediately
- [Phase 05-01]: resolveClickUrl extracted as exported pure function — accepts raw metadata (unknown), returns validated URL string; testable without DB mocks
- [Phase 05-01]: CLICK event query removed from redirect handler — SENT event link_map is the sole URL resolution path; CLICK INSERT in recordClick unchanged (write-only audit)
- [Phase 05-01]: targetUrl passed to reply.redirect() as raw string (not url.href) — prevents double-encoding of percent chars in UTM params and encoded query strings
- [Phase 05-02]: resolveSegmentContactIds placed in @twmail/shared — workers package has no api dependency; shared is importable by both packages
- [Phase 05-02]: within_days operator semantics: column >= (now - N*86400000ms), meaning contacts active within last N days
- [Phase 05-02]: between operator uses two-element array [low, high] matching existing SegmentRule.value type union
- [Phase 06-02]: CORS origin callback checks !origin first (SNS webhooks have no Origin header and must pass before allowlist check)
- [Phase 06-02]: helmet registered with contentSecurityPolicy disabled (pure API, CSP would interfere with tracking pixel)
- [Phase 06-02]: ALLOWED_ORIGINS defaults to empty string — empty means all origins blocked, safe default for production
- [Phase 06-01]: BullMQ bundles its own ioredis vendor — use as unknown as ConnectionOptions instead of as any for type-safe connection passing
- [Phase 06-01]: Redis noeviction policy chosen to guarantee BullMQ job keys are never evicted under memory pressure
- [Phase 06-01]: SES_CONFIG_SET const at module scope so env var is read once at startup; docker-compose passes SES_CONFIGURATION_SET with marketing default
- [Phase 07-code-quality-tooling]: no-misused-promises added as error alongside no-floating-promises; unsafe-* rules downgraded to warn for Phase 8
- [Phase 07-code-quality-tooling]: void operator used for process.on and setInterval async callbacks — fire-and-forget pattern preserved correctly
- [Phase 07-code-quality-tooling]: lint-staged --max-warnings=0 enforces zero warnings in staged files while allowing existing warnings in unstaged code
- [Phase 07-02]: processBounceSnsEvent uses ON CONFLICT (message_id, event_type) not (sns_message_id) — events table has no sns_message_id column; idempotency key is (message, event_type) pair
- [Phase 07-02]: Segment unit tests use Kysely DummyDriver + PostgresAdapter for compile() — no real DB connection required, SQL structure verified via string assertions
- [Phase 07-02]: shouldSkipSend refactored out of bulk-send worker to accept db as parameter for mock injection in unit tests
- [Phase 08-02]: SNS webhook errors use inline reply.send with { error: { code, message } } — no AppError throw, SNS callers ignore error bodies
- [Phase 08-02]: Error shape regression test uses source-code scan (fs.readFileSync) — no DB or HTTP required, fastest guard
- [Phase 08-02]: INVALID_SNS_SIGNATURE, INVALID_SUBSCRIBE_URL, INVALID_SNS_MESSAGE used as inline error codes in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- [Phase 08-01]: sql<SqlBool> template literals with sql.ref() for heterogeneous column comparisons — Kysely eb() operator calls reject RawBuilder as value
- [Phase 08-01]: Expression<SqlBool> as common return type for buildRuleFilter/buildSingleRule/buildJsonbRule covering both ExpressionWrapper and RawBuilder
- [Phase 08-01]: redis as unknown as ConnectionOptions established pattern for all BullMQ connections — ioredis structural compatibility without any cast
- [Phase 08-01]: Fastify plugin async functions suppress require-await per-function with eslint-disable-next-line — plugin type requires async signature
- [Phase 09-01]: enqueueWebhookDelivery creates ephemeral Queue per call and calls queue.close() after add — consistent with bulk-send resend path
- [Phase 09-01]: verifyHmacSignature returns false on length mismatch instead of throwing — timingSafeEqual requires equal-length buffers
- [Phase 09-01]: source-code scan strategy used for rate limiter and auto-disable tests — avoids Redis/DB setup while guaranteeing config thresholds
- [Phase 09-operational-readiness]: [Phase 09-02]: SENDING stall recovery re-enqueues without status change — campaign-send worker resolves via shouldSkipSend dedup
- [Phase 09-operational-readiness]: [Phase 09-02]: STALE_SENDING_THRESHOLD_MS = 600_000ms exported at module scope for testability
- [Phase 09-operational-readiness]: [Phase 09-02]: Timezone conversion uses ECMA-262 Date constructor + Zod .datetime() — no Luxon needed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Phase 1: Scheduled campaign trigger (BUG-05)~~ RESOLVED — scheduler.ts created
- ~~Phase 1: Resend-to-non-openers wire-up (BUG-06)~~ RESOLVED — wired in bulk-send completion path
- Phase 6: PgBouncer version must be >= 1.21 for prepared statement safety in transaction mode — verify from docker-compose.yml
- Phase 6: Bull Board is currently a placeholder container — needs scoping (config-only or full build)
- All phases: SES account sending limit may differ from the 40/sec default — verify via SES console before Phase 9
